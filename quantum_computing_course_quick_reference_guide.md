## 💡 KEY CONCEPTS VISUALIZED

```
CLASSICAL vs QUANTUM COMPUTING

Classical Bit:              Quantum Bit (Qubit):
┌─────┬─────┐             ┌──────────┐
│  0  │  1  │ (choose)    │ 0 AND 1  │ (superposition)
└─────┴─────┘             └──────────┘
One state                  Many states
at a time                  simultaneously


SUPERPOSITION:             ENTANGLEMENT:
Single qubit in           Multiple qubits
multiple states           deeply correlated
simultaneously            

|0⟩ + |1⟩ = both          If one is 0,
                          the other is 1
                          (perfectly correlated)


QUANTUM ADVANTAGE:
Classical: Check 1 million items → 500,000 checks
Quantum:   Check 1 million items → 1,000 checks
           (Quadratic speedup!)
