## NOTES & TIPS

**Pro Tip 1: Create Concept Hierarchy Documents**  
For each module, create a single-page document showing concept dependencies. Example:

```
Quantum Computing Fundamentals
├── Hardware Platforms
│   ├── Superconducting Qubits → Cryogenics → Dilution Fridges
│   ├── Ion Traps → Laser Control → Cooling
│   └── Photonic → NKT Photonics Tour
├── Quantum Mechanics Basics
│   ├── Qubits & Bloch Sphere
│   ├── Superposition & Entanglement
│   └── Measurement & Collapse
└── DiVincenzo Criteria (evaluated per platform)
```

**Pro Tip 2: Use the 80/20 Rule**  

- 80% of practical value comes from understanding: qubits, superposition, entanglement, basic gates, Grover/QAOA, resource estimation
- 20% comes from deep theory (ZX calculus, rigorous proofs, etc.)
- Focus your time accordingly based on goals

**Pro Tip 3: The "Teach It Back" Method**  
After each module, prepare a 10-minute explanation as if teaching a peer. Gaps in your explanation = gaps in understanding. Fix those gaps immediately.

**Pro Tip 4: Build a "Quantum Intuition Library"**  
For each major concept, collect 3-5 real-world analogies or visual examples. This library becomes invaluable for long-term retention and explaining concepts to others.

**Pro Tip 5: Leverage the WISER Discord**  

- Post one question per week seeking peer input
- Review others' explanations of concepts
- Join or start study groups aligned with your learning pace
