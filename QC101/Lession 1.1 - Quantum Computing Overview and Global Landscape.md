## The Value Proposition: Today vs. Tomorrow

### Common Misconception
Many believe you need quantum gate-based technology outperforming classical solutions to see value. **This is a fallacy.**

### Actual Reality
- Real businesses generating ROI today using quantum-inspired and quantum annealing technologies
- Many organizations still using spreadsheets, open-source solvers, or classical optimization
- Organizations are primed for stepping up to advanced compute solutions

### Strategic Advantage
- Companies implementing quantum-inspired/annealing tech today:
  - Generate immediate ROI
  - Build expertise and workflows
  - Future-proof their operations for quantum gate-based technologies
  - Avoid costly re-formulation and replacement cycles

### Example: Healthcare Company Success
- Goal: Create workflow to submit problems across 8 different solvers (classical to quantum-inspired)
- Result: 93% improvement in solution quality over 3 years
- Impact: Clear ROI demonstration and roadmap to quantum maturity
